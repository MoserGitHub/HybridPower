# Background

@Kunzmann2022

## Aim

- Overview 'power' terminology
- Focus on 'hybrid' approach (95%), 5% proper Bayesian 
- Use of SAFE-SSPE trial as example

**Definition 'hybrid'** (Spiegelhalter 2004, Section 6.5.2)

*'[...] we have a prior distribution to use in our study design, but that the conclusions of the study will be entirely classical and will not make use of the prior [...]'*

## A timeline of selected literature

- Book of Spiegelhalter (2004): Bayesian Approaches to Clinical Trials and Health Care Evaluation
- O'Hagan (2005): Assurance in Clincial Trials
- Rufibach et al (2016): Bayesian predictive power: choice of prior [...]
- **Kunzmann et al. (2021): A review of Bayesian Perspectives on Sample Size Derivations from Confirmatory Trials**
- Book of Grieve (2022): Hybrid Frequentist/Bayesian Power and Bayesian Power in Planning Clinical Trials

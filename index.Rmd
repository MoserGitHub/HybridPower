# Background

The terminology of 'power' is often imprecisely used @Kunzmann2022. Kunzmann et al. suggest to use the neutral term 'probability of rejection'. The classical (frequentist) 'power' is defined as the probability of rejection given that the alternative hypothesis is true. Yet, frequentist power calculations do not include uncertainties of the treatment effect. Bayesian and hybrid approaches include such uncertainties in their calculations. The following manuscript uses the different approaches (frequentist, Bayesian and hybrid) for the calculation of 'the probability of rejection'.

**Definition 'hybrid'** (@Spiegelhalter2003, Section 6.5.2)

*'[...] we have a prior distribution to use in our study design, but that the conclusions of the study will be entirely classical and will not make use of the prior [...]'*

## General notation and abbreviations

- $iid$: independent and identically distributed
- pdf: probability density function
- $\phi$: Probability density function of the standard Gaussian distribution
- $\Phi$: Cumulative distribution function of the standard Gaussian distribution
- $\Phi^{-1}$: Quantile function of the standard Gaussian distribution function

## Some 'Bayesian' concepts

- **Prior predictive distribution**: Situation *before* a sample was taken. Let $\theta$ be a realisation of a random variable $\Theta$ with pdf $p(\theta)$. Then for a future observation $\tilde X$

$$
p(\tilde x)=\int_\Theta p(\tilde x, \theta)d\theta=\int_\Theta \underbrace{p(\tilde x | \theta)}_{likelihood}\underbrace{p(\theta)}_{prior}d\theta
$$

- **Posterior predictive distribution**: Situation *after* a sample was taken. Let $\theta$ be a realisation of a random variable $\Theta$ with pdf $p(\theta)$. Then for a future observation $\tilde X$ and observed $X$

$$
p(\tilde x|x)=\int_\Theta p(\tilde x | \theta, x)p(\theta|x)d\theta=\int_\Theta \underbrace{p(\tilde x | \theta)}_{likelihood}\underbrace{p(\theta|x)}_{prior}d\theta,
$$

since $X$ is independent $\tilde X$.

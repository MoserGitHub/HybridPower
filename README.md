The terminology of 'power' is often imprecisely used @Kunzmann2022. Kunzmann et al. suggest to use the neutral term 'probability of rejection'. The classical (frequentist) 'power' is defined as the probability of rejection given that the alternative hypothesis is true. Yet, frequentist power calculations do not include uncertainties of the treatment effect. Bayesian and hybrid approaches include such uncertainties in their calculations. The following manuscript uses the different approaches (frequentist, Bayesian and hybrid) for the calculation of 'the probability of rejection'.
